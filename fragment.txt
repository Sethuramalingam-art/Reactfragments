In React, "Fragment" and "Div" are used interchangeably. 
  The main difference between the two is that "Fragment" clears out all extra divs from a DOM tree
  while "Div" adds a div to the DOM tree.

With React Fragments, we can create code that is cleaner and easier to read. 
    It renders components more quickly and uses less memory. Every element is rendered as intended. 
    While Div expands the DOM due to the long nested nodes that occur when there are too many HTML tags on your website.

The div element has more methods and properties, which causes it to consume more memory which can make the page slow load time; 
the prototype chain is like HTMLDivElement -> HTMLElement -> Element -> Node -> EventTarget, whereas the React fragment 
  has fewer methods with the prototype chain DocumentFragment -> Node -> EventTarget.
